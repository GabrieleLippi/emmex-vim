# Emmex-vim

This plugin aims to be a lighter version of emmet-vim, focused on React's JSX.

## JSX tags

This plugin is focused on React way of writing HTML, a.k.a JSX. By default it will add a *className* attribute on each element.

### Tags currently supported:

  * div
  * p
  * span
  * header
  * footer
  * main
  * a
  * aside
  * video
  * img
  * h1
  * h2
  * h3
  * h4
  * h5
  * h6
  * nav
  * input
  * html5 scaffolding

#### How it works:

This plugin take advante of the excellent builtin vim's abbreviation system, so the tag will expand right after the *space* is pressed.
