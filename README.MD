## What is markabbreviations-vim?

This plugin is just a collection of shortcuts for some of the most common `HTML` tags, leveraging the awesome vim's `iabbrev` mappings.
For more info on the topic see the chapter about abbreviations on [learnvimscriptthehardway](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/08.html) or type `:h iabbrev` from whitin vim.
